Dedicated to : ps2nfo and TeamXecuter
------------------------------------------------------
Ps2nfo said they didnt rip or even plan do release 
an iso loader, but they sent tones of mail to all
press agences to say :

"Groups of hackers are close to releasing new technology 
that would allow any copied game--rather than the current,
limited set--to be played on the PSP, an editor at gaming 
site PS2NFO.com, who identified himself as "CJ," said in 
an e-mail Tuesday."

CJ more than just a thief,you're an ass hole, 
just make profit, profit and profit again, 
you are only a shitty money maker and a 
website hits maker.

Fuck OFF !
-------------------------------------------------------
Xecuter for you it's differents ;) i just hope you 
will find little time to answer me by a little 
graphical humoristic "or not" production ;)

i know you're well respected and you are good tech
( not as much as the ORIGA brothers) but good. ;)

i just hope you wont say one time again that 
free launcher suxx and we all need mod from
you ;)

kisses to all your team ppl ;)
-------------------------------------------------------
to all WAB supporter :
know that something will be release even if
ps2nfo (or any other the team name they will use)
release our stollen v3.
-------------------------------------------------------
to sony:
Need someone to check your v2.0 firmware ?
-------------------------------------------------------
To All:
more than just wait for games or launcher, be 
productive, grab psp compiler, and pspdsk
